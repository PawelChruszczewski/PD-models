# Probability of Default (PD) calculation in R
The purpose of the project is to calculate one-year probability of corporate default. 
Currently, the project includes:
<li> PD calculation based on the KMV-Merton model.
<li> PD calculation based on Scorecard and logistic regression model
Here is the link to my repository, in which one can find probability of default estimation in Python, using Machine Learning models: https://github.com/PawelChruszczewski/Corporate-Defaults---ML-Models

In the project, I used bankruptcy data from the UCLA LoPucki database and fundamental data about companies from the Compustat database.
The data cleaning process was conducted in Python. 
If one would like to get more details on data cleaning or any other stage of the process,
